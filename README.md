WHY IS THIS DATA ANALYSIS IMPORTANT?

Movie producers, enthusiasts and customers can use these insights to :

Predict which movies are likely to perform well?

What appears to influence how well a movie performs, using gross profit as the metric of success?

How to improve upon movies that underperform using these correlations and metric of success(gross profit)

 
BACKGROUND 


The movie dataset contains a collection of authors, companies, budgets, gross profits , customer ratings, votes 
and other related information that correlates with movie production and its release.

HYPOYHESIS



There will be a high and positive correlation between a movie's gross profit and budget

There will be a high correlation between a movie's gross profit and the company's name

This will, therefore, mean that a company's reputation and high investment in its movie will more likely lead to more profitability from it.

METHODOLOGY

Anaconda, python and Jupyter notebook were primarily used for this project.

Seaborn, MatplotLib, Pandas and NumPy were tools used to analyze and visualize the correlations between the relevant sets of data investigated. Visualizations were made using Seaborn and MatplotLib ,within the Jupyter Notebook.

Before the use of data, data cleaning was performed ,checking for duplicates ,removal of decimals and splitting information set in one column into various columns for further analysis. 

Correlation charts such as heat maps and regression plots were used to analyze if there were high correlations between gross profits and budget and company name and gross profits.


CONCLUSION

There was a high correlation between the gross profit and the budget

The second highest correlation was between gross profits and customer votes

Company name (reputation) had a low correlation. implying that it has little influence on whether the movie would perform well or not.
